I post practice problems I solve from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) to practice bioinformatics.

## Links
My Rosalind account [here](https://rosalind.info/users/dinosawrfish/)

## Problems
I will update a link to the problem on Rosalind and my code solution as I go.

All problems are done in Python.
